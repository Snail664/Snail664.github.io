          After working with python flask on a prototype Booking App for the RSAF. I was
          In search of more powerful frontend frameworks. And that is how I stumbled upon
          React. In these project I honed my html and css skills, while learning about React
          as well as the concept of frontend application state for the first time.

        </div>
        
        <p>
          As I gained greater expertise with react. I started exploring state management libraries such
          as Redux. This application allows users to create, edit and delete streams, similar to services
          such as Twitch and Discord. It is complete with a basic RTMP server which allows users to stream
          videos. Through this project I learnt how to handle CRUD operations with React as well as the use
          of OAuth.

        <h1 class="pb-3 text-center orange">Ride Friend</h1>
        <p>
          Ride Friend is a car-pooling application still under development. Ride Friend is collaboration
           with 2 others. It is the fist project I intend to take to production. Stay tuned for more info!

            <h2 class="p-3 text-center">Collaboration</h2>
            <p>
              Being my first collaborative project. Through Ride Friend I am learning to work with others by 
              better organising and planning team tasks. Collaboration has also provided me an opportunity to 
              hone my communication skills, in a setting as professional as possible barring internships or 
              university.

            <h2 class="p-3 text-center">Empathy</h2>
            <p>
              Working on Ride Friend has taught me how to solve problems on the go, with the target audience in mind.
               Trying to understand the target audience has helped develop greater empathy.

            <h2 class="p-3 text-center">Skills</h2>
            <p>
              Ride Friend is deliberately built with the use of a technology stack I was unfamiliar with rather than
               something I had done a thousand times. This skill of quick learning is highly applicable in the fast paced
                tech industry; and is a skill I am focused on developing.
