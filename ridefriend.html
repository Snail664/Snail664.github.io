      Ride Friend is a car-pooling application still under development. Ride Friend is collaboration
       with 2 others. It is the fist project I intend to take to production. Stay tuned for more info!

        <h2 class="p-3 text-center">Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
          Being my first collaborative project. Through Ride Friend I am learning to work with others by 
          better organising and planning team tasks. Collaboration has also provided me an opportunity to 
          hone my communication skills, in a setting as professional as possible barring internships or 
          university.

        <h2 class="p-3 text-center">Empathy</h2>
        <p>
          Working on Ride Friend has taught me how to solve problems on the go, with the target audience in mind.
           Trying to understand the target audience has helped develop greater empathy.

        <h2 class="p-3 text-center">Skills</h2>
        <p>
          Ride Friend is deliberately built with the use of a technology stack I was unfamiliar with rather than
           something I had done a thousand times. This skill of quick learning is highly applicable in the fast paced
            tech industry; and is a skill I am focused on developing.
